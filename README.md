# KAT
 KAT is a Matlab-based toolbox that implement an exact reconstruction algorithm for helical CT reconstruction.
 
 Most of the codes in the toolbox are vectorized and so the computations can be transfered from CPU and GPU. In the toolbox, we provide both the CPU and GPU implementations and the switching is controlled by setting the value of parameter 'usegpu' to be 0 or 1.
